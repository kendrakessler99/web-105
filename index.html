    <h1>Nightshade by Andrea Cremer</h1>
    <h2>What is this book about...  </h2>
    <p> The Nightshade Series is about a girl named Calla. She can control her pack, but not her heart . . . While other teenage girls daydream about boys, Calla Tor imagines ripping out her enemies’ throats. And she wouldn’t have it any other way. Calla was born a warrior and on her eighteenth-birthday she’ll become the alpha female of the next generation of Guardian wolves. Until she runs from her destiny to be with the boy she loves.</p>
